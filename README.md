# Shunting Yard

This project is a Java implementation of the shunting yard algorithm. The Shunting yard algorithm is a method for parsing mathematical expressions specified in infix notation. For more information on the topic, you can read more here: [shunting yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm).

## The project

The project takes in an input of an infix expression (basically a form of mathematical notation that most people are used to i.e. 1 + 2) and outputs the reverse Polish notation of the expression (i.e. 1 2 +).
